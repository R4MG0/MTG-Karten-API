# MTG Cards sorter

## Abstract
With my API you can create your own cards, mana colors, subtypes and types and search for them.
A card has a type, a name, a subtype and one or more mana colors.
If you want to delete or update a card, mana, subtype and type you can do it.
You can search a card, mana, subtype and type with their ID or with his name(mana with color).
You has the possibility to search a card with the name and subtype, with the name and type, 
with the name and mana color or with the subtype and mana color.


## Conclusion
Fortunately, I was able to deliver the API on time.
In the end I had difficulties writing the unittests, because they did not work, although the program worked without problems.
If I had a question, I first asked Simeon or Kimi.
If we hadn't any idea at all how to solve the problem, I asked Ivan for help.
I am very satisfied with my API and were able to do everything we wanted to do in my API.
